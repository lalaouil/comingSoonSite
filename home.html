                            <h2>A Playdate That Gets You</h2>
						    <p>
                                One of the most heartbreaking experiences for parents is witnessing their child not fitting in. Parents of children on the autism spectrum are familiar with this painâ€“sometimes due to their child withdrawing and other times due to children shunning their child. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As professionals working in the field of applied behavior analysis, we can help you. We've used our extensive knowledge from working with children on the spectrum to design a site and create an algorithm pairing ideal playdates.
							</p>
							<p>
								You and your child will finally be able to experience the benefits and joys of positive social interaction. Gets You Inc. will be here to help you find a playdate that gets you.
