	        </div>
			<p>
			    While leading a support group for parents of children on the autism spectrum, Bahia would frequently listen to the parents discuss playdates that had gone wrong and how a meltdown would mean that their child would not be invited back. The parents feared that their children would grow up without the experience of a close bond with a peer. Bahia realized many of the parents had the same concerns.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Bahia's knowledge and experience with autism, she knew that simply pairing these children based on their age and/or interest was not enough. Children on the spectrum have very specific characteristics that shouldn’t be ignored, but taken into consideration to make a successful match. She approached her mother, who had recently become a computer programer, to see if between them, they could come up with a way to connect these children. As they got into the planning of the site they envisioned, they knew that this service would benefit a lot of families within the autism community. They also knew that they couldn’t do it on their own.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Having worked with Dr. Amanda Nicolson to help make Amanda’s dream of opening the California Autism Center become a reality, Bahia witnessed how eager Amanda was to help this population. Knowing Amanda’s level of expertise within the autism community and in starting a new business, Bahia and Laurie knew she would be an important asset to the team.
			</p>
			<p>
			    As a relatively new programmer, Laurie knew she would need the help of an experienced Sr. Developer. She turned to someone she had worked with on a previous project, Henry Jackson, a 20+ year veteran developer and founder of HAJ Computer Consulting Group. With Henry’s expertise in coding and having founded a successful business, he too became an important asset to the team.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The team quickly realized that our solution to the playdate problem could be extend to connect people on the spectrum through all stages of their lives. After our release of A Playdate That Gets You, we plan to release A Friend That Gets You. This will make matches of preteens all the way up to senior citizens, looking for friendships or romantic relationships. Soon to follow, will be A Roommate That Gets You, matching those who are looking to take the next step towards independence.
			</p>
			<p>
			    It's Gets You Inc.’s mission to help connect individuals on the autism spectrum with others that truly understand them, regardless of the stage of life they are in.
