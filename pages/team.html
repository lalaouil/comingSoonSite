			<p>Bahia Alaoui is a co-founder, and the CEO of Gets You Inc. She received her bachelor’s degree in psychology from California State University Fresno, and in May 2017, she will receive her master’s degree in Counseling with an option in Marriage, Family, and Child Counseling also from California State University Fresno. Bahia is currently taking classes, completing practicum hours at an internship, and working at the California Autism Center. She is currently a Marriage and Family Therapist trainee at Fresno Family Counseling Center. Through this internship, she provides counseling services to children, adults, families, and couples.</p>
			
			<p>In 2012, Bahia began working for Dr. Nicolson as a Behavior Therapist at the Autism Center at Fresno State. When Dr. Nicolson founded the California Autism Center, Bahia was one of the first few employees to be hired on. Bahia began her position at the California Autism Center as a Behavior Therapist, was eventually promoted to Case Assistant, and then to Clinical Supervisor. She is now in the process of transitioning to a new position that will utilize her expertise in both autism and Applied Behavior Analysis, as well as her expertise as a Marriage and Family Therapist.</p>
			
			<p>Bahia has combined her knowledge and experience from both fields and positions to hold support groups for parents of children on the autism spectrum, as well as one for siblings of children on the autism spectrum. Though she is very busy and responsible, she is also a fun-loving free-spirit who enjoys being in nature and spending time with friends and family.</p>

	    <section id="modalB-description" class="modal-description">
		    <p>Laurie left college to move to Morocco in 1978 where she lived for 12 years. While there, she worked with several small charities devoted to helping the poor and the disabled in Casablanca and Marrakech. She began her family and then returned to the United States and college, where she pursued a degree in Creative Writing at San Francisco State University, culminating in a job as the restaurant editor for the San Francisco Independent and later working in the print advertising industry.</p>
	
            <p>After raising her children, she became enthralled with the tech industry and its potential to make positive changes in the world, so she began learning to code at home with the help of various websites and Railsbridge. She graduated from General Assembly's WDI bootcamp in 2015 and has been coding ever since.</p>
	
	        <p>Laurie considers the San Francisco Bay Area home, but she is currently residing in the Sacramento area. She is Nana to three adorable grandchildren and the proud mother of three, with her youngest now serving as her CEO!</p>
