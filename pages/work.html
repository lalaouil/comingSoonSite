	        	<p>When you begin your membership with Gets You Inc. you will be asked to set up your profile and complete a new member questionnaire. This questionnaire is the key to opening the doorway to your connections.</p>
	        	
	        	<p>You will be asked questions about basic demographics, and you will also be asked questions about what makes you unique. We want to know all about your interests, likes, dislikes, quirks, and special skills. These questions were developed purposively, so we can suggest the best connections.</p>
	        	
	        	<p>You have the option to be very specific in your answers or you can be more general in your answers. Providing more general responses will cast a wider net of possible matches; however, the more specific you are, the more accurate we can be in suggesting your matchs.</p>
	        	 
	        	<p>After submitting the questionnaire, you will receive a list of recommended matches, but you're always able to connect with the entire Gets You community, as well.</p>
	        	  
	        	<p> What sets us apart? A focus on matching the unique characteristics of each individual whoâ€™s a part of the Gets You community. Every person is unique, and you are no different.</p>
